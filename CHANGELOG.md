Changelog
=========

Major work such as new features, bug fixes, feature deprecations, and other
breaking changes should be noted here. It should be more concise than `git log`.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

[Unreleased]
------------

### Added

- Function table/id based ecall/ocall dispatching
   - oeedger8r generates ecall tables and ocall tables
   - Dispatching based on function-id (index into table)
   - oeedger8r generates oe_create_foo_enclave function for foo.edl

### Changed

- oe_create_enclave takes two additional parameters: ocall_table, ocall_table_size.
- Update mbedTLS library to version 2.7.6.
- Update MUSL libc to version 1.1.20.
- Update LLVM libcxx to version 7.0.0.
   - Some libcxx headers (e.g. string) now use c++11 template features and may require
     compiling with the -std=c++11 option when building with GCC.

### Deprecated
- String based ocalls/ecalls, OE_ECALL, OE_OCALL macros.

[v0.4.0] - 2018-10-08
---------------------

v0.4.0 is the first public preview release, with numerous breaking changes from v0.1.0
as listed below.

### Added

- Support building Open Enclave SDK apps with Clang-7.
- Support Intel EDL for host & enclave stub generation with oeedger8r tool.
- Support full SGX DCAP remote report (quote) revocation.
- Expand documentation for running on different configurations.
- Add pkg-config files for building Open Enclave apps in C/C++ for GCC or Clang.
- Add data sealing sample.
- Add `oe_call_host_by_address()` to allow enclaves to make OCALLs by callback pointer.
- Add `oe_get_enclave()` to obtain enclave handle to return to host.
- Add `oe_get_target_info()` to support SGX local attestation.
- Add CMake export configuration to SDK (experimental).

### Changed

- Standardize naming convention on new [Development Guide](docs/DevelopmentGuide.md).
- Standardize Open Enclave APIs to use `size_t` type for buffer sizes.
- Standardize Open Enclave APIs to always clear output parameters on error return.
- Change report type detection logic.
   - Reports generated by Open Enclave are no longer transparently usable by Intel SGX SDK.
- Change `oe_identity.authorID` field to `oe_identity.signerID`.
- Clean up thread local storage on return from ECALL.
- Refactor liboecore and liboeenclave dependency.
   - All enclave apps must now link liboeenclave.
- Refactor liboecore and liboelibc dependency.
   - All enclave apps should call libc for C functions instead.
- Break up remote attestation sample into 4 separate samples.
- Simplify `oe_get_report()` so it doesn't accept unused `reportdata` on host side.
- Reduce the set of `oe_result` values returned.
- Update mbedTLS library to version 2.7.5.
- Update LLVM libcxx to version 6.0.1.
- Update MUSL libc to version 1.1.19.
- Update libunwind to version 1.3.

### Deprecated

- Deprecate oe_call_host and oe_call_enclave methods in favor of EDL generated interfaces.

### Removed

- Block re-entrant ECALLs. A host servicing an OCALL cannot make an ECALL back into the enclave.
- Remove oe_thread functions. All enclave apps should use libc/libcxx thread functions instead.
- Remove API reference from SDK package. Refer to https://openenclave.io/apidocs/v0.4 instead.
- Remove outdated documents including DesignOverview.pdf.
- Remove oegen, oedump and oeelf tools.
- Remove CMake-based samples.
- Replace test signing PEM files with runtime generated test keys.

### Fixed

- Add appropriate validations for ELF64 in Open Enclave loader.
- Expand libc/libcxx test coverage.

### Security

- Build all libraries with Clang-7 Spectre-1 mitigation (-x86-speculative-load-hardening).
- Update code to use safe CRT and secure memset/zero memory methods.
- Fix integer overflows and add arithmetic boundary checks in Open Enclave runtime.
- Fix cert chain validation during Open Enclave quote verification.
